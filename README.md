# Python_projects
# Nachiket_kale_test_A
In firsr file that is achiket_kale_test_A.py, I have created a function which takes in (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) as a input and calculates whethere two lines defined by the input on x axis overlap or not.

# Nachiket_kale_test_B
In second file that is nachiket_kale_test_B.py I have defined a function which takes two  version strings as inputs and compares them.
# following are the test cases:
str1='1.2.3' , str2='1.2.3.1' result str2 is greater
str1='v1.2.3' , str2='v1.2.3.1' result str2 is greater
str1='1.2.3' , str2='1.2.2.1' result str1 is greater
str1='v'1.2.3' , str2='v'1.2.3.1' result str2 is greater
str1='1.2.3v' , str2='1.2.3.1v' result str2 is greater

The major consideration that is takin into accounnt is that the comparison of two versions is dependent only on the numbers.

This code can be optimized further by using recursive function consept.

# Calculator
A simple calculator is creading using tkinter to create a gui.
Further update will be done shortly to increase functionalities of the calculator.
To run the program, simply pull the file, open the terminal go to the file path and use the following command to run the file
python calculator.py
